                    <p><strong>Sales associate </strong> <br>
                        
                        In this role, I was responsible for a range of tasks aimed at ensuring smooth and 
                        efficient grocery store operation. This included calculating sales prices and 
                        meticulously tracking total purchases, as well as processing both cash and credit 
                        transactions with precision. I took pride in creating visually appealing displays 
                        by organizing and arranging items on promotional displays and shelves. Security in 
                        cash handling was a top priority, and I managed cash transactions with utmost care. 
                        Additionally, I provided excellent customer service by promptly addressing inquiries 
                        and resolving concerns over the phone. Collaborating with vendors to track down 
                        out-of-stock items for our customers was also part of my responsibilities. 
                        I played a crucial role in maintaining inventory accuracy by assisting in the 
                        receipt and processing of grocery deliveries, all while ensuring proper item rotation
                        to keep products fresh and prevent spoilage or expiration. 
                        I regularly restocked shelves to keep the grocery sales area attractive and ready
                        for customers, and I gladly assisted customers in finding suitable replacements 
                        for out-of-stock items, ensuring their satisfaction.

                        seamless and enjoyable dining experience for our customers. 
                        My duties included taking and accurately filling orders,
                        efficiently serving food and beverages, and meticulously preparing dishes according
                        to the specified recipes. I also played a pivotal role in managing inventory and 
                        supplies to ensure that we always had what we needed to meet customer demands. 
                        Maintaining a high level of cleanliness and adhering to sanitation standards was
                        paramount, involving tasks such as seating customers, operating the cash register,
                        and training new employees to uphold these standards. I took pride in keeping our 
                        work environment spotless and orderly by following health codes, consistently 
                        cleaning tables, floors, and workstations, and disposing of waste appropriately.
