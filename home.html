                <p>Hello, I'm Colicia Mckain. I'm passionate about information technology 
                    it has been an interest for me since my earlier years in high school and right then and their 
                    I decided that I was going to pursue a career in this field. After much research 
                    I stumbled upon System administration and Networking. These two fields grabbed my interest and here 
                    I am now as an NSCC student studying IT systems security and management at the Nova Scotia Community College. 
                    I aim to showcase to you all the skills I have learned in my website and development course along with my other courses in this portfolio. 
                </p>
